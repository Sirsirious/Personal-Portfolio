# Biography

Born from an Electrical Engineer dad and an arts teacher mom in provincial southeastern Brazil, Tiago was raised among both math and culture.
His parents provided him all he needed to have a good education, paying good schools and providing all that was necessary.

In the early 90's, his dad brought home the first personal computer Tiago had access to. It was a rare thing back then in Brazil.
During his early youth, different from many developers and data scientist bios, Tiago did not learn to program or do magic with code.
Instead, he learned to play videogames, and this was his moto for a long time. He loved strategy and historical games such as Age of Empires,
The Settlers III and many others.
During his teen years, he got into more gaming, having access to the internet, he started to play some of the earlier MMO's, 
mainly with middle ages topic (that's why his github profile is called sirsirious).

In 2008, his dad went to Tallahassee, FL, to study for a Post Doctorate in Electrical Engineering in UFL. This is where Tiago
practiced some of the english that he learned while playing videogames.

All the passion for historical games got into him the love for History, which took him to the university to learn the topic from 2009 to 2012.

It was in the university that Tiago met his wife, Priscila, who was just finishing a technical degree on informatics.
Before graduating, Tiago asked Priscila to marry, and they are a team to the day.

One day, Priscila asked Tiago some help with her programming assignment, since many things were in english and she was not profficient in the language.
It was Tiago's first contact with real programming. It was a simple html webpage with javascript callbacks. At first, it was all messy,
but while looking at it, Tiago noted there were some patterns where he could just copy and change some parts.
He helped Priscila get an A and saw that programming was not something that was not that hard.

A while later, he decided to step back from History. Teaching in schools was not what he wanted and he did not have the sycophant skills
needed to get into a Master's in the area. That when a friend told him about a neat online bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences
offered by a famous brazilian university. After many years since his last SAT exam (in Brazil, it's called Vestibular), 
Tiago went back to basic math to get the necessary skills to get back into college. And he managed to be the 2nd greatest score, 
only a half point behind the first place. 

For three years he put all his effort into learning and understanding computers. By then, he started to love Java and 
got his first developer skills in that language. He was the first to graduate in his class, with scoring over 90% in all courses.
Before graduating, Tiago already passed an exam to become an IT Technician for a Federal Education Institution.

Less than one year after that, he attempted to start a Masters in Computer Sciences and was approved to study/research
in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Originally with a project towards detecting ADHD from user search patterns,
he was gotten into a question-answering project lead by his original supervisor. In that track, he got in contact
with Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding, the latter when he attended classes in the Brazilian 
FrameNet lab.

And while learning new tools, skills and techniques, Tiago procceeded in his Question-Answer research. It was there that 
he first got in contact with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. With some patience he built a combined methodology to use
both Java (which he was more used to) and Python to perform Natural Language Processing over portuguese inputs. He managed
to create a graph-based approach to perform Question Answering for domains with lack of data. This was the subject of his
Master's thesis (you can find it [here](http://bdtd.ibict.br/vufind/Record/UFJF_1a7f7ef794dec9ca80c8305a91b71108)).

After completing his Master's, Tiago continued to study Natural Language Processing and Data Science. He decided to go into
a task of learning all the important steps of NLP that were not used in his Master's. For that he started his Medium
Article Series, that can be read at his page in [tfduque.medium.com](tfduque.medium.com).

He also continued learning to program in Python, becoming a proven Python developer both according to Linkedin and 
Pluralsight. That lead him to one of his most important free-time projects, the set of tools that goes side by side
with his Medium series, nlpytools, a  NLP toolset that has the purpose of include all of the most import NLP tasks
with easy to understand and follow code. This website has many live samples of this tool in the NLP menu. You
can read more about nlpytools in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/nlpytools/#description) or 
[github](https://github.com/Sirsirious/NLPTools).

Aside from this research and free-time experience, Tiago is being proven in his many skills by consulting and
freelancing to many commercial-grade companies. Just to mention a few projects he worked on:

* Analytics project: main developer and engineer behind a *full* data analytics engine to work in the backbone of a retail 
software (the inspiration behind the Data Analytics examples). Tasks: REST API development (flask),  User Segmentation, 
  Recommendation Strategies and Time-series analysis.
  
* NLP pipeline: data scientist responsible for transforming data, modifying and applying special linguistics algorithms.
